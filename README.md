## Howdy! 👋
I am currently an undergraduate computer engineering student minoring in physics and mathematics at Texas A&M University. My profile will primarily be dedicated to the projects that I have and will continue to work on in the coming years. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at lam.nguyen1637@gmail.com.

## About my work 🛠️
For now, the ideas for my projects come from other things that I am working on. I will mostly be coding in Python, however that may change as I continue to study other languages throughout my time in university. Because I am still at an early intermediate level of programming knowledge, my projects will not be extraordinarily complicated, and some may be rather simple. If anyone nevertheless is interested in my work, I sincerely appreciate and thank you for your support.
